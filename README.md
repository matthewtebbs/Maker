# Projects Ordered by Board / Kit

## [Let's Start Coding](http://letsstartcoding.com) **Ultimate Kit**

_Note: None of these projects are endorsed or promoted by Let's Start Coding._

Their board and firmware is compatible with the Arduino Uno + Arduino IDE so I suspect that these projects MAY work with [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) and other manufacturer's maker boards.
